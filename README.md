The Whit Davis PTO web site is versioned in git on GitHub.

If you have a GitHub account, you can collaborate on making the site the best it can be and keeping it updated.

You could fork the site, make changes, and issue a pull request.  Or, I may just make you a collaborator.  Files can be edited directly from within GitHub.

I still need to automate updating the site based on changes made to this repository.
